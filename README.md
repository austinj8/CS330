Here are the responses without dashes:  

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I approach software design by first identifying the project requirements and breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. From there, I outline a structure that considers both functionality and efficiency before starting implementation.  

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**  
Working on this project has helped me improve my ability to plan and structure a 3D scene, particularly in terms of lighting and texture application. I also learned how to troubleshoot design issues related to material properties and object placement.  

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**  
I started by conceptualizing the scene and sketching a rough layout. Then, I focused on building the basic geometry before adding textures and refining the lighting. Throughout the process, I tested different settings to achieve a more realistic result.  

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**  
The structured approach I used, starting with a rough plan and refining it step by step, can be applied to other projects, whether in 3D modeling, software development, or other design-based tasks. It ensures that major elements are in place before fine-tuning details.  

**How do I approach developing programs?**  
I approach development by first understanding the problem I’m solving, then structuring the code in a way that makes it modular and maintainable. I test components regularly to catch issues early and iterate as needed.  

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**  
I learned to experiment with different lighting setups and material properties to see how they interact within the scene. I also relied more on incremental adjustments rather than making large changes all at once, which helped streamline the troubleshooting process.  

**How did iteration factor into your development?**  
Iteration was key in refining the scene. I often adjusted lighting values, repositioned objects, and tested different textures to get the right look. Small changes over multiple iterations helped improve the final result.  

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**  
Early on, I focused more on just making things work, but as I progressed, I became more intentional about optimizing the structure of my code. I also started relying more on documentation and debugging techniques to solve issues more efficiently.  

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**  
Computer science provides the problem-solving skills and technical knowledge needed to approach complex challenges in a structured way. These skills are useful in many areas, whether working with graphics, software development, or data analysis.  

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**  
Understanding computational graphics has given me a deeper appreciation for how visual elements are created and manipulated in digital environments. These skills can be valuable in future coursework involving simulations, UI/UX design, or even data visualization.  

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**  
The ability to work with 3D models, lighting, and textures is relevant in fields like game design, virtual simulations, and digital media. Even outside those areas, the problem-solving approach used in computational graphics can apply to various technical and creative fields.
